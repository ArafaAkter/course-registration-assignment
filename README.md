# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

 

 # Here i am writing two questions answer

 # Question 1 : Add at least 3 project features

- Feature - 1 : In course registration interface all courses list were added. Where student can see what types of course are here .And then they can select their course by clicking select button .
- Feature - 2 : By clicking select button student can select one course at a time. If a student selects a course and repeats the course again  she/he will see a toast.
-Feature - 3 : By clicking select button student can see their total credit. 

# Question 2 : Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project. 

 - In my project i used four different state with different name . For example, for showing all courses i use a state  this name is allCourse. For showing credit hour i use   totalCreditHours state.For showing  remaining i use  totalRemaining state and at last for selecting course i use selectCourse state.
